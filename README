Project : froyo(2.2.2_r1) vender for HTC Tattoo device


Notes:

* Froyo-AOSP.patch MUST be applied before compiling the whole android project.

  This patch mainly contains:

  - ability to compile with java 1.6
  - libdvm.so optimization by Jim Huang
  - adjusted prelink mapping to avoid link_image error
  - the patch from Cy to implement 'exec' command in init
  - FM implementation

  NOTE: extra sources are stored in ./extras/absent.

* Every hardware is fully working now.

* Modules added into the Kernel: Bfs 363, tattoo-hack, and compcache.

* Packages got from Cy: busybox, bash, Superuser, FileManager, and FM.
