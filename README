Project : froyo(2.2.2_r1) vender for HTC Tattoo device

  This patch mainly contains:

  - libdvm.so optimization by Jim Huang(the header is in extra/)
  - adjusted prelink mapping to avoid link_image error
  - camera snapshot working and Camera app could exit properly
  - the patch from Cy to implement 'exec' command in init
  - the patch from Cy to make the headset icon visible
  - fixes of compilation error
  - FM implementation

  NOTE: added source files are located at ./extras/absent directory.

* Kernel had been applied with backported BFS-316 patch.

* tattoo-hack.ko module had been built in the kernel.

* busybox(Cy version) was needed to run scripts in /system/etc/init.d.

* Superuser and FileManager apks should be downloaded from github if you want.

* Camera preview is not working right now.
