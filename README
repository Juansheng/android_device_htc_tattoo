Project : froyo-plus-aosp vender for HTC Tattoo device


Notes:

* Froyo-AOSP.patch MUST be applied before compiling the whole android project.

  This patch mainly contains:

  - implemented BIONIC LIBC compiled well with Cyanogen's busybox and 
    system/extra/su projects
  - compilation can be done on i686 Linux Host
  - adjusted prelink mapping to avoid link_image error
  - the patch from Cy to make Camera work on Tattoo without GL
  - the patch from Cy to implement 'exec' command in init
  - optimization of Launcher2

* Kernel had been applied with backported BFS-316 patch.

* tattoo-hack.ko module had been built in the kernel.

* busybox(Cy version) was needed to run scripts in /system/etc/init.d.

* Camera is lamed right now. FM doesn't work. All other hardwares rock.
